# Welcome to E-buy Shop

E-buy Shop is an Android application built with Flutter that caters to two user roles: customers and admins. It offers a seamless shopping experience for customers, allowing them to view, favorite, add to cart, and contact the owner directly from the app.. On the other hand, admins have access to an admin panel where they can perform actions such as adding, removing, editing, and displaying categories and products.
